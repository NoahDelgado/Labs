# Labo03 - Run a first container

## Pedagogical intent

In this lab, you'll:

* Get to grips with the first Docker commands,
* Run your first Docker
* Familiarize yourself with port publishing

---

Note: the docker engine must be running

## Task 01 - Get to grips with the first Docker commands

* List all images present on your installation

[INPUT]
```bash

```

[OUTPUT]
