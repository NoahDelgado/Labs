# Labo03 - Run a first container

## Pedagogical intent

In this lab, you'll:

* Get to grips with the first Docker commands,
* Run your first Docker
* Familiarize yourself with port publishing

---

Note: the docker engine must be running

## Task 01 - Get to grips with the first Docker commands

* List all images present on your installation

[INPUT]
```bash
docker images
```

[OUTPUT]
```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID   CREATED   SIZE
```

* Get the official Nginx image using this command

[INPUT]
```bash
docker pull nginx
```

[OUTPUT]
```
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/nginx

* List -again- all image present on your installation

[INPUT]
```bash
docker images
```

[OUTPUT]
```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
nginx        latest    e784f4560448   2 weeks ago   188MB
```

Note : 188 MB is the size of your image... check it.

* List -again- all image present on your installation

[INPUT]
```bash
docker images
```

[OUTPUT]
```
//TODO
```

* List all Docker

[INPUT]
```
docker ps -a
```

[OUTPUT]
```
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

## Task 02 - Run the container

* Run Nginx Docker

[INPUT]
```
docker run nginx
```

[OUTPUT]
```
$ docker run nginx
